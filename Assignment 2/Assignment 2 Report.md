# Language Analysis
The implementation process in Python, Java, and C each presented unique experiences. The following sections will discuss the development process.

### Python
Python, with its high-level, interpreted nature, offered a smooth development process, as reflected in its top rank for readability and development speed. The language's simplicity and clear syntax made the code easy to read and write, which likely contributed to a faster development speed. However, Python's execution time for the monthly report generation was slightly slower than Java and significantly slower than C, which is a common trade-off with interpreted languages.

However, this would be my preferred language for this task due to its readability and development speed. The execution time is not a significant concern for this task, since the dataset is very small.

### Java
Java, on the other hand, provided a balance between readability and performance. While it was ranked third for readability, it was still relatively easy to debug, as indicated by its top rank in that category. This is due to Java's strong typing and exception handling, which makes it easier to catch and fix errors. The execution time for the monthly report generation was slightly faster than Python but slower than C, which is consistent with Java's intermediate position between high-level interpreted languages and low-level compiled languages.

### C
C, as a low-level compiled language, offered the fastest execution time by a significant margin, which is one of its key strengths. However, it was ranked last for ease of debugging and development speed. This is due to C's lower-level syntax and lack of certain features that are standard in higher-level languages, such as automatic memory management and object-oriented programming. Despite these challenges, the experience with C was valuable in understanding the trade-offs between performance and ease of use in different programming languages.

### Table of Comparison
||Readability | Ease of Debugging | Development Speed | Execution Time for monthly report generation (sec)| Lines of Code | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Python**| R1 | R2 | R1 | 0.011066 | 118
|**Java** | R3 | R1 | R2 | 0.011353 | 162
|**C** | R2 | R3 | R3 | 0.000343 | 230
