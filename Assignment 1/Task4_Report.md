# Student Database Comparison Analysis

## Data Organization

### Array Implementation
In the array implementation, data is organized using separate arrays for each attribute (id, name, and age). This leads to parallel arrays, which can complicate the code and make it error-prone when managing different attributes. Adding a new attribute, such as "grade," would require changes in multiple arrays, risking inconsistency.

### Struct Implementation
The struct implementation uses a more organized approach by grouping related attributes (id, name, and age) into a single struct, Student. This results in a cleaner and more maintainable structure. Adding a new attribute becomes straightforward as it only involves updating the struct definition and does not require changes in multiple places.
