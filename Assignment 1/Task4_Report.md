# Student Database Comparison Analysis

## Data Organization

### Array Implementation
In the array implementation, data is organized using separate arrays for each attribute (id, name, and age). This leads to parallel arrays, which can complicate the code and make it error-prone when managing different attributes. Adding a new attribute, such as "grade," would require changes in multiple arrays, risking inconsistency.

### Struct Implementation
The struct implementation uses a more organized approach by grouping related attributes (id, name, and age) into a single struct, Student. This results in a cleaner and more maintainable structure. Adding a new attribute becomes straightforward as it only involves updating the struct definition and does not require changes in multiple places.

## Code Maintainability

### Array Implementation
In the array implementation, adding a new attribute (e.g., "grade") would involve modifications in multiple functions and arrays. The risk of introducing errors is higher, as changes need to be made consistently in different places. The code lacks encapsulation, making it more challenging to maintain.

### Struct Implementation
The struct implementation demonstrates better code maintainability. When adding a new attribute, modifications are limited to the struct definition and the functions that use it. This encapsulation reduces the likelihood of errors and makes the code more modular. The struct implementation follows the principles of encapsulation and abstraction.

### Readability

### Array Implementation
The array implementation uses parallel arrays, making it less readable and more error-prone. Understanding the relationships between different attributes (id, name, and age) requires keeping track of multiple arrays simultaneously. This can lead to confusion and hinder code comprehension.

### Struct Implementation
The struct implementation improves readability by grouping related attributes together. Accessing student attributes involves using a single struct, which simplifies code comprehension. The use of a struct enhances the readability of function signatures, making it clear that they operate on student entities.
