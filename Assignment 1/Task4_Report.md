## Data Organization

### Array Implementation
In the array implementation, data is organized using separate arrays for each attribute (id, name, and age). This leads to parallel arrays, which can complicate the code and make it error-prone when managing different attributes. Adding a new attribute, such as "grade," would require changes in multiple arrays, risking inconsistency.
